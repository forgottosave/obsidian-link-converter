# Obsidian-link Converter
This script replaces all obsidian-style links in a file, or folder with proper markdown links.

## Usage
Provide a file, or folder as the first argument:
```
./olc.sh folder-name/
```

## Warning
There currently is a bug, if the replacename \[\[name|*replacename*\]\] contains certain special characters. But I'm working on it :)
